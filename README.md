### Config ⚙️

To get importance in your directory, ```cd``` into it and clone importance relative to it:

```bash
>>> cd [ project_name ]
>>> git clone "https://github.com/VladUsatii/importance.git"
>>> cd importance
>>> bash setup.sh # first time user only
```

To test it, type ```cls```:

```bash
>>> cls
```

To actually see color on some of the directories:

```bash
>>> vi active.txt # if active project
>>> vi important.txt # if important project
```

Enjoy 😊
